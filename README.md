# Standard PSO (SPSO) Language Implementations

This repository contains multiple language implementations of the **Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO)** algorithm. It serves both as an archive of the original SPSO2011 and as a collaborative development ground for the upcoming SPSO2025 standard.

## Overview

The Standard PSO (SPSO) algorithm is a foundational variant of Particle Swarm Optimization, providing a clear baseline for research, benchmarking, and algorithmic comparisons. This repository preserves implementations across several programming languages while working actively toward defining the next generation standard, **SPSO2025**.

### Available Implementations

- **C Version (Original)**: Direct derivative of the SPSO2011 reference implementation by Maurice Clerc and collaborators. It maintains the integrity and original specifications of the 2011 standard.

- **C++ Version (Port)**: Modernized C++ port of SPSO2011 featuring object-oriented design and enhanced maintainability, faithfully preserving algorithmic behavior.

- **Python Version (Reimplementation)**: Pythonic recreation of SPSO2011 emphasizing readability, ease of use, and suitability for research environments.

- **Rust Version (Coming Soon)**: Planned future implementation prioritizing safety, efficiency, and performance.

## Repository Goals

1. **Preservation**: Document and maintain historical accuracy of the original SPSO2011 implementation.
2. **Consistency**: Offer reliable, consistent implementations across multiple programming languages.
3. **Innovation**: Develop the SPSO2025 standard, incorporating insights and best practices learned over more than a decade of research.
4. **Research Facilitation**: Provide robust benchmarks, clearly defined parameters, and reproducible results to support comparative PSO research.

## Historical Context

The SPSO2011 standard was established in response to the need for a stable, universally accepted baseline PSO variant. Key contributions of SPSO2011 include:

- **Coordinate Independence (Rotation Invariance)**: Particle updates are independent of coordinate systems, improving fairness across benchmarks.
- **Clear Particle Update Rules**: Well-defined particle behavior and parameters ensure reproducibility.
- **Standard Parameterization**: Defaults provide a reliable baseline for comparisons.
- **Benchmark Functions**: Comprehensive standard benchmarks enable meaningful comparative studies.

Detailed historical notes and algorithmic specifics are documented within the [original C implementation directory](c-original/ReadMe.txt).

## SPSO2025 Development

The upcoming SPSO2025 standard aims to:

- Modernize the SPSO algorithm while preserving fundamental principles.
- Integrate valuable research insights gained since 2011.
- Define clear versioning and ensure backward compatibility where possible.
- Establish enhanced and more rigorous benchmark procedures.

Contributions and discussions are encouraged as we shape this new standard.
